This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my first pass attempt at web development. Almost everything here was created with the above npm command, I am starting to learn what all the pieces are and how everything works!

As of first commit: I changed the app from the default page to just be blank and say hello world (also deleted some files). 

As of second commit: Have a couple components working together with events/state etc. Basic styling.
