This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my first pass attempt at web development. Almost everything here was created with the above npm command, I am starting to learn what all the pieces are and how everything works!

As of first commit: I changed the app from the default page to just be blank and say hello world (also deleted some files). 

As of second commit: Have a couple components working together with events/state etc. Basic styling. 

As of third commit: I added a node backend based on a tutorial here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-react-frontend-a-node-express-backend-and-connect-them-together-c5798926047c/
This is connected to a mongoDB cluster that I created for free and have a single collection storing greetings. The app now can store greetings and retrieve the most recently stored entry. Still looks pretty basic but there are a lot of moving parts. The backend is in a folder ('backend') and is mostly generated by express-generator in npx, but I made a bunch of modifications following the tutorial and adding a POST handler to update the database (and changing the GET to retrieve the most recent greeting).
